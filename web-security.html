        <p><b>Web security </b>is the act of protecting websites from attacks such as unauthorized
          access, modification, disruption, or destruction of data. On a number of occasions, websites will go
          down because of these attacks, and in some cases confidential
          user data is leaked to the public, exposing these users to risks. </p>

        <p>Good website security requires an effort throughout the entire website: whether it is the web application
          itself, the configuration of the web server, or front-facing code. Even something like policies for confidential
          passwords creation or renewal plays a huge role in effective website security. </p>

        <p>There are many ways to enable effective web security. Usually, if one is using a server-side web framework,
          effective defense mechanisms against common attacks are enabled. Configuring a web server by enabling HTTPS,
          for example, can help mitigate any other attacks that might occur.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">2.1 - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h2>

        <h4 class="text-center">Video on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h4>

        <p><b>XSS</b> is a category of attacks that allow an attacker to put client-side scripts through the websites into the
          browsers of other users. Since this code travels from the website itself into the browser, the code is usually
          trusted and has the ability to do a variety of things. For example, it can send a user’s authorization cookie to
          the attacker, which allows them to log into another website as if they were the user themselves. This gives the
          attacker the ability to do anything that the user would be able to do, such as access their bank account, their
          email, and other things.</p>

        <p>XSS vulnerabilities are the most common security threat.</p>

        <p>XSS vulnerabilities are <b>reflected</b> and <b>persistent</b>, depending on how the site returns the code to the browser.</p>

        <p><b>Reflected </b>XSS vulnerability occurs when user content to the server is returned immediately and unmodified
          in the browser. </p>

        <p>For example, an attacker can construct a search link that contains malicious script as a parameter and email
          it to a user. If the user clicks this link, the script will be executed as the page loads. This would then
          give the attacker all the information they need to impersonate the user, being able to access any confidential
          or sensitive data belonging to them.</p>

        <p><b>Persistent </b> XSS vulnerability occurs when the malicious script is stored on the website and then redisplayed
          later, seemingly unmodified, for other users to execute. </p>

        <p>For example, a discussion board that allows for unmodified HTML in the comment section could store a malicious
          script. When the comment is displayed, the script is executed and can send the users’ information to the attacker. </p>

        <p>This attack is popular and powerful, since the attacker might not even engage directly with any of the users
          they are targeting.</p>

        <p><b>Most common vulnerable data: </b>Data from POST or GET requests is most common for XSS vulnerabilities.
          However, any data from a browser is vulnerable, whether it’s uploaded user files or cookie data.</p>

        <p><b>Defense against XSS vulnerabilities:</b></p>

        <p>Remove or disable any markup that could contain instructions to run code - in HTML, this includes elements
          such as <i>script, object, embed and link </i>.</p>

        <p>Modifying user data so it can’t be used to run scripts is known as <b>input sanitization</b>. Many web frameworks
          sanitize user input by default.</p>

        <p><b>SQL injection</b> vulnerabilities give attackers the ability to execute SQL code on a database, allowing
          data access, modification, or deletion regardless of the attacker’s permissions. Successful attacks might utilize
          a hoax identity, create new identities with administration rights, access all the data on the server, or modify the
          data to make it unusable. </p>

        <p>There are many different types of SQL injections: error based, boolean errors, time-based</p>

        <p><b>How they occur:</b> SQL injection vulnerabilities become present if user input that is passed into a
          query changes the meaning of the statement. To avoid this sort of attack, it needs to be ensured that user
          data passed into the query can’t change the nature of it.</p>

        <p>One way to do this is to <b>escape</b> the characters in user input that have a special meaning in SQL.
          Web frameworks often just take care of character escaping. </p>

        <hr>

        <p><b>CSRF</b> attacks allow a malicious attacker to execute actions using credentials of a user without the user’s
          knowledge or consent.</p>

        <p>For example, if an attacker knows a site that allows logged-in users to send money to other specific accounts by using
          an HTTP POST request, they can construct a form that includes their bank details and an amount of money as hidden
          details to email to other users with a submit button. If the user clicks the submit button, a POST request will
          be sent containing the transaction details and any cookies — the server checks the cookies, and if the user is
          logged in to the site, the transaction will be completed. </p>

        <p><b>Prevention: </b>A way to prevent this attack is for the server to require that POST requests include a
          user-specific site-generated secret. This secret would be supplied by the server when sending the web form -
          therefore the attacker would not be able to create their own form. </p>

        <p><b>Note: </b>Modern web frameworks usually include CSRF prevention mechanisms.</p>

        <hr>

        <p><b>Clickjacking: </b>An attacker routes clicks meant for a top level site to a hidden page underneath. For
          example, site might look like a legitimate bank site but only looks like it; captures login information that
          the attacker can use </p>

        <p><b>Denial of Service (DoS): </b>DoS is achieved by flooding a site with fake requests so that legitimate users
          can’t access the site. There might just be numerous requests or might consume large amounts of resources. Defenses
          usually identify and block malicious traffic while allowing legitimate messages through.</p>

        <p><b>Directory Traversal: </b>Attacker tries to access parts of the server file system that they shouldn’t be able
          to access - occurs when the user is able to pass filenames that include file system navigation characters. A solution
          to protecting against this type of attack is to sanitize the input.</p>

        <p><b>File Inclusion: </b>Attacker is able to specify an “unintended” file for display and when file is loaded,
          it might be executed on the web server or client side. A solution
          to protecting against this type of attack is to sanitize the input.</p>

        <p><b>Command injection: </b>Allows attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the host operating system.
          it might be executed on the web server or client side. A solution to protecting against this type of attack
          is to sanitize the input.</p>

        <p><b>General Points: </b>Most of these attacks are successful when a web application trusts the data coming from
          a browser. So, the best way to protect yourself from a variety of attacks is to sanitize all user-originating data
          before it’s displayed in the browser, used in SQL queries, or passed to an operating system or file system call.</p>

        <p>To outline what was presented in the video, here are a few key points to keep in mind in order to identify and patch some
          vulnerabilities to your website and web services:</p>

        <ol>

          <li>Use more effective password management - encourage strong passwords and the practice of changing it regularly,
            two factor authentication.</li>

          <p></p>

          <li>Configure web server to use HTTPS and HSTS. HTTPS encrypts data sent between client and server - ensures that
            credentials, cookies, POST requests data and header information are not easily available to attackers.</li>

          <p></p>

          <li>Keep track of the most popular threats (OWASP list), and address most common vulnerabilities first.</li>

          <p></p>

          <li>Use vulnerability scanning tools to try and pinpoint the weaknesses of yuor system.</li>

          <p></p>

          <li>Only store and display data that you need. For example, only show the last 4 digits of a credit card number,
            enough for the user to recognize stored information.</li>

        </ol>

        <h1 class="text-center">Section 1 - What is Cryptography?</h1>
        <p>In our current society, data is a fundamental resource that is constantly being created
            and transported. With this, there needs to be a way such that the information being sent
            has the property of <b>confidentiality</b>.</p>

        <p><b>Confidentiality:</b> Confidentiality is the guarantee that information being sent is only able to be read
              and understood by the expected recipient(s) of the private message. To help ensure that
              confidentiality is achieved, this is where <b>cryptography</b> comes in.</p>

        <p><b>Cryptography:</b> Kaspersky Lab, a cybersecurity provider, defines cryptography as "the
            study of secure communications techniques that allow for only the sender and intended recipient
            of a message to view its contents". This reflects the desire to achieve confidentiality. In order for a
            sender of a message and receiver of a message to communicate, there are two steps. First, the sender
            <b>encrypts</b> the plain text message to create a <b>cipher</b>; then the sender sends the cipher to the receiver.
            The receiver then <b>decrypts</b> the message in order to read the contents of the original plaintext
            message. The encryption and decryption center on the need for one or more <b>keys</b> that will either be made
            public, or will be secretly shared between the sender and receiver. More on keys will be presented later.</p>

        <p><b>Encryption: </b>Symantec Corporation defines encryption as the process of "helping protect personal
            data by using a 'secret code' to scramble it so that it cannot be read by anyone who doesn't have the
            code key". The scrambled message is called the cipher text. Encryption "locks up" the data
            so that no one, except those with the key, can "unlock it" and read the plaintext message inside.</p>

        <p><b>Decryption: </b>Decryption is the 'undoing' of the encryption. So, with decryption, the receiver gets a
            cipher text, and applies the key to it, along with the known decryption algorithm and in return, this algorithm
            pops out the original plain text message. Decryption "unlocks" the data that was being "locked up" in the
            cipher text.</p>

        <p><b>Cryptanalysis: </b>Encryption and Decryption methods usually rely on some sort of underlying math or algorithm
            that is fairly hard break unless you know the key that is used in the encryption or decryption algorithm. This being said,
            cryptanalysis is the art of decrypting a cipher text without actually knowing the key. This may be due to the
            the <b>key space</b> is relatively small, meaning that it would be feasible to simply try out every single possible
            key. It also could be due to that if the attacker knows the encryption algorithm, then the resulting cipher text
            could give away hints at what the key should be and with this information the attacker can recover the plaintext message.
            Moral of the story is that there could be a number of reasons why a cryptanalysis attack may be able to be carried out,
            constant innovation in this field, especially as technology and computing power are always improving and becoming
            more efficient.</p>

        <p>After discussing the basics of encryption let's analyze the question of why encryption is used in practice. Well,
            as we saw above, encryption provides confidentiality. This is extremelt important to provide in practice because
            we all use online services that use our data, and with these, we want to be assured that only the people that
            we have given the right to use and see our data can see it. Further, data breaches are always on the news; this
            goes to show that people out there want to steal data because in today's world, data is extremely valuable. With encryption,
            another level of protection and privacy is added. But also, in some cases, laws and regulations require it. Some
            examples are HIPPA, FERPA, and FCPA. These regulations require the use of encryption to protect the information of the
            community they aim to protect.</p>

        <p>Cryptography is a very interesting subject with a clear evolution throughout time, in the next section let's
            take a look at the arch of cryptography and how it has changed over time.</p>

        <hr>

        <h1 class="text-center">Section 2 - The History of Cryptography</h1>

        <p>Encryption methods have changed throughout time. A lot of this evolutions can be attributed to advancements in
            technology. Encryption originated in order to hide messages from those who were deemed untrustworthy by the sender.
            As time went on, encryption has seen many successful, and unsuccessful, applications when it comes to war. In more
            modern times, encryption is used in the online services we rely on in order to help protect our personal information.
            This section will highlight some key advancements in the history of cryptography, and several of the advancements mentioned
            will be touched upon in more detail in following sections. The general timeline information was taken from
            Melis Jackob's article entitled History of Encryption written for the SANS Institute.</p>

        <p><b>1900 BC: </b> Egyptians were using hieroglyphs as the main form of writing. However, a form of hieroglyphs that
            was unusual and non-standard were used by some in order to communicate secret messages. This is the first known
            usage of written cryptography</p>

        <p><b>487 BC: </b> Greeks developed a method to send secret messages that used a special staff called a skytale.</p>

        <p><b>100ish BC: </b> Julius Caesar used the famed Caesar Cipher to send messages to his trusted acquaintances.</p>

        <p><b>1553: </b> Giovan Batista Belaso introduced the idea of repeated polyalphabetic ciphers. This inspired the creation
            of the Vigen√®re Cipher</p>

        <p><b>1933-1945: </b>The Enigma machine was used in WWII by Nazi Germany</p>

        <p><b>1976: </b>Diffie and Hellman (of the famed Diffie-Hellman key exchange) introduced the idea of public key
            cryptography.</p>

        <p><b>1977: </b>Rivest, Shamir and Adleman developed the RSA encryption algorithm which was one of the first applications
            of Diffie and Hellman's proposal of public key cryptography</p>

        <p>Encryption methods are always innovating, and as we see throughout time and will continue to see with some examples
            later, methods for encryption are bound to become obsolete as time goes on. This is because someone is able to
            do a cryptanalysis and break the method, or simply because computing power allows for previously unbreakable system to be
            broken via a brute force attack on the key set. This process of methods becoming obsolete, especially in the context of
            modern encryption methods can be looked at through the lens of the implications of <b>Moore's Law</b>.</p>

        <p><b>Moore's Law: </b> This is an observation that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles approximately
            every two years, which also leads to decreases in costs of computers. This law has some huge implications. With more transistors
            on a microchip, and with decreasing costs, the amount of computation that is feasible for individuals, but also
            large corporations, to harness increases as time goes on. This shows how over time certain encryption methods become obsolete.
            This is because previously 'hard' computations become less hard the more computation power is available. In some cases,
            previously infeasible brute force attacks through all the possible keys become possible. In other situations, more
            computation power could allow for the ability to find weaknesses in the scheme and then allow for the ability for
            a cryptanalysis attack to be carried out. So, we see that as technology improves, older encryption methods can become obsolete
            and new methods need to be created (or old methods updated) to keep pace with the ever-improving technology.</p>

        <h1 class="text-center">Section 3 - Symmetric-Key Cryptography</h1>

          <p>In symmetric-key cryptography, a key is used in order to encrypt the plaintext method and
              then <b>the same</b> key is used to decrypt the cipher text. This would mean that the symmetric key must be
              exchanged between the sender and receiver so that both the encryption and decryption can be carried out.</p>

        <h1 class="text-center">Section 4 - Symmetric-Key Encryption Examples</h1>

          <p>In this section, we will see explicit examples of symmetric-key encryption and will learn a few basic
              encryption/ and cryptanalysis techniques!</p>

          <div id="caesar" class="list-group col-md">

              <button class="btn btn-light " data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#caesar" href="#collapsecaesar"><h2 class="text-center">4.1 - Caesar Cipher</h2></button>

          <div id="collapsecaesar" class="panel-collapse collapse in">

          <p>This cipher was created by Julius Caesar (hence the name).</p>

          <p><b>Encryption: </b>This is a basic shift cipher, which means that given the plaintext message, all letters
            will be shifted by the same factor, and that factor is given by the key. Let the letter $A=0, B=1, \ldots, Z=25$. The key is then an integer.</p>

          <p>So, defining $m_i$ as the character in the ith index of the message, $c_i$ as the character in the ith index of
              the resulting cipher, and $k$ as the key, the encryption method is defined by the following:</p>

          <p>$$c_i = m_i + k (mod 26)$$</p>

          <p><b>Decryption: </b> Given the cipher text and the key, the decryption method is simply the undoing of the encryption method.
          <p>So, defining $m_i$ as the character in the ith index of the message, $c_i$ as the character in the ith index of
              the resulting cipher, and $k$ as the key, the decryption method is defined by the following:</p>

          <p>$$m_i = c_i - k (mod 26)$$</p>

          <p><b>Cryptanalysis: </b>The Caesar Cipher is a very weak encryption scheme with a relatively small key space. Although
              the value of the key $k$ can be any integer greater than 0, however due to the size of the alphabet being 26 letters long,
              there are really only 26 completely distinct keys. By this there means given any message $m$, there are only 26 possible
              cipher texts that can be generated because every letter is shifted by the exact same factor.</p>

          <p>So, due to the small size of the key space, let's observe a brute force way to break the encryption method.
          Given the cipher text, we can simply attempt to decrypt the message with keys 0 to 25 and read the resulting message.
          One of the resulting messages will make sense, and this will be the original plaintext message. Especially with
          today's computing, by only having to test out 26 possible keys, makes this encryption scheme extremely easy to break.</p>

          <p>Another important point to notice is that even though each given letter in the message gets mapped to a different letter in
            the encryption process, every $A$ will map to the same value, same with every $B$, $C$, etc. This opens up opportunity for the cipher
            to be decrypted (especially in cases of a long cipher) via a letter frequency analysis. If a letter in the cipher text
            occurs many many times, you can assume under most cases, that the corresponding letter in the plaintext message would
            be something like an $E$ or $A$, and probably not an $X$ or $Z$. With long cipher texts, the frequencies of letters in the cipher
            will approximately match frequencies of letter in the language, and thus the cipher can be mapped back to the plaintext message fairly
            easily. This is just another example of why this cipher is very weak.</p>

                    The "one" on one time pad is because the key should only be used once so that if an attacker sees several ciphers,
                    they will get no information about the key or plaintext because the key changes every time</p>

                  <p><b>Encryption: </b>We are given a message $m$, and then a string of letters which will be the key $k$

                        the ith letter of the key. Then, to create the ith letter of the cipher text, we perform a shift, much
                        like the Caesar Cipher, by shifting the message letter by the value of the letter in the key.</p>

              <div id="collapsevigenere" class="panel-collapse collapse in">

                  <p>The Vigen√®re Cipher was proposed by Blaise de Vigen√®re in the 16th Century. It was in response to noticing that
                    more simple ciphers, like the Caesar Cipher, can be broken quite easily with longer cipher texts by analyzing the
                    frequency of letter distributions. So, this was developed to try and stop this problem. The Vigen√®re Cipher is
                    regarded as a polyalphabetic substitution cipher because it uses more than one cipher alphabet (whereas the
                      Caesar Cipher only used one).
                  </p>

                  <p><b>Encryption: </b>The encryption method is very similar to the one time pad, except the key is
                    not required to be as long as the message. To make up for this, the key is simply extended to be as
                    long as the message. If the message is of length 10 and the key is of length 5, then when performing the
                    encryption, it would follow the same process as the one time pad where the key is simply written two
                    times to match up with all the letters of the plaintext message.</p>

                  <div class="container">
                      <div class="row">
                          <div class="col-sm-8 mx-auto d-block">
                              <figure class="text-center">
                                  <img class="img-responsive img-fluid align-content-center" src="crypto-pictures/vigenere.png">
                                  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 2: Vigen√®re Cipher Tableau</figcaption>
                              </figure>
                          </div>
                      </div>
                  </div>

                  <p>So, defining $m_i$ as the character in the ith index of the message, $c_i$ as the character in the ith index of
                      the resulting cipher, and $k_i$ as the character in the ith index of the key (after the key is extended),
                      the decryption method is defined by the following:</p>

                  <p>$$c_i = m_i + k_i (mod 26)$$</p>

                  <p><b>Decryption: </b>Given the cipher text and the key, the decryption method is simply the undoing of the encryption method above. </p>

                  <p>So, defining $m_i$ as the character in the ith index of the message, $c_i$ as the character in the ith index of
                      the resulting cipher, and $k_i$ as the character in the ith index of the key (after extending), the decryption method is defined by the following:</p>

                  <p>$$m_i = c_i - k_i (mod 26)$$</p>

                  <p><b>Cryptanalysis:</b> The cipher at first glance appears to be extremely tough to beat,
                      but in practice this is not the case. </p>

                  <p>If the key is simply one letter long, then the encryption method
                      is equivalent to that of the Caesar Cipher which we have seen is very easy to break.</p>

                  <p></p>However, if the key is longer than one, two mathematicians in the early 1900s, Kasiki and Friedman, independently developed mathematical tests
                    to help determine the length of the key used given only the cipher text. Then, given the length of the key,
                    the problem is reduced down to a set of Caesar Ciphers which can then be individually broken.</p>

                  <p>In the case of really long keys and keys that are the same length of the plaintext message, it gives the same
                    security properties as the one time pad.</p>

                  <p><b>The Civil War:</b> The cipher was used in the Civil War by the Confederacy. However, the Confederate leadership who
                    were sending these encrypted messages liked to repeat the keys that were being used. The three most common keys
                    that were used were: "MANCHESTER BLUFF", "COMPLETE VICTORY", and "COME RETRIBUTION". The Union was able
                    to regularly break the codes due to the use of repeated key words. So, much like the one time pad, the
                    key word should not be used time and time again or else it gives rise to the ability to sense patterns and break
                      the code more easily.</p>

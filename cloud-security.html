          <p class="text-center">In this section on Cloud Security, we hope you gain a foundational understanding of the following
              topics:</p>

          <ul>
              <li class="list-group-item">1. Difference between traditional and cloud security and the importance of
                  security in a cloud environment </li>

          </ul>

        <h1 class="text-center">Section 1 - Traditional Security vs Cloud Security</h1>

        <p><b>Motivation: </b>Cloud security involves a set of defensive methods placed in order to protect data stored
            in cloud systems from breaches and data loss. Many modern companies and enterprises are shifting their structure
            to the cloud model. As it grows more and more popular, security becomes more of a pressing matter to address. </p>

        <p>The cloud infrastructure proposes unique security challenges from traditional infrastructures. Traditional
            systems usually rely on perimeter security protocol. Perimeter security is a set of physical and programmatic
            security policies that provide levels of protection on a conceptual borderline against remote malicious activity.
            Traditionally, it is believed that any connectivity to systems or organizations outside of an organization provides
            an opening for unauthorized entities to gain access or tamper with information resources. Upon this defined
            conceptual boundary, security controls were deployed to protect the data within it. However, in a cloud computing
            model, there is no defined perimeter, weakening the effectiveness of this measure. </p>

          <hr>

        <h1 class="text-center">Section 2 - Components in Cloud Security: Trust</h1>

        <p>Trust in a cloud environment depends heavily on the selected deployment model (Saas, Paas, Laas). In the case
            of public or community clouds, control is delegated to the organization owning the infrastructure. When
            deploying on a public cloud, control is mitigated to the infrastructure owner to enforce a sufficient security
            policy that guarantees that appropriate security activities are being performed to ensure that risk is reduced.
            This introduces a number of risks and threats, as essentially security is related to trusting the processes
            and computing base implemented by the cloud owner. It is crucial to differentiate between deployment models,
            as a private cloud, where the infrastructure is operated and managed on premise by a private organization,
            does not introduce additional unique security challenges, as trust remains within the organization.
            In such a situation, the infrastructures owner remains the data and process owner.</p>

        <h1 class="text-center">Section 3 - Components in Cloud Security: Trust</h1>

        <p>This section will provide an overview of different ways you can manage security in the cloud. Be sure to check out
            the videos for a more in depth look at these different methods!</p>

        <p><b>Firewalls </b>protect the perimeter of your network security and your end users. Firewalls also safeguard
            traffic between different apps stored in the cloud.</p>

        <p><b>Access controls </b> protect data by allowing you to set access lists for different assets. For instance,
            you might allow specific employees application access, while restricting others. A general rule is to provide
            employeesâ€™ access to only the tools they need to do their job. By maintaining strict access control, you can
            keep critical documents from malicious insiders or hackers with stolen credentials.</p>

          <hr>

          <p><b>Data masking</b> encrypts identifiable information, such as names.
              This maintains data integrity by keeping important information private. With data masking, a medical
              company can share data without violating HIPAA laws, for example. Be sure to see our section on
            <a href="./crypto.html">Cryptography</a> to learn more about encryption!</p>

          <p><b>Threat intelligence</b> spots security threats and ranks them in order of importance. This feature helps you
              protect mission-critical assets from threats.</p>

          <p><b>Disaster recovery</b> provides flexible and reliable failover for required services in the event of any service
              interruptions, including those caused by natural or man-made disasters or disruptions. This makes use of the
              cloud's flexibility to minimize cost and maximize benefits.</p>

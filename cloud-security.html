          <h1 class="text-center">Learning Objectives:</h1>

          <p class="text-center">In this section on Cloud Security, we hope you gain a foundational understanding of the following
              topics:</p>

          <ul>
              <li class="list-group-item">1. Difference between traditional and cloud security and the importance of

              <li class="list-group-item">3. Fundamental security countermeasures</li>
          </ul>

        <h1 class="text-center">Section 1 - Traditional Security vs Cloud Security</h1>

        <p><b>Motivation: </b>Cloud security involves a set of defensive methods placed in order to protect data stored
            in cloud systems from breaches and data loss. Many modern companies and enterprises are shifting their structure
            to the cloud model. As it grows more and more popular, security becomes more of a pressing matter to address. </p>

        <p>The cloud infrastructure proposes unique security challenges from traditional infrastructures. Traditional
            systems usually rely on perimeter security protocol. Perimeter security is a set of physical and programmatic
            security policies that provide levels of protection on a conceptual borderline against remote malicious activity.
            Traditionally, it is believed that any connectivity to systems or organizations outside of an organization provides
            an opening for unauthorized entities to gain access or tamper with information resources. Upon this defined
            conceptual boundary, security controls were deployed to protect the data within it. However, in a cloud computing
            model, there is no defined perimeter, weakening the effectiveness of this measure. </p>

          <hr>

        <h1 class="text-center">Section 2 - Components in Cloud Security: Trust</h1>

        <p>Trust in a cloud environment depends heavily on the selected deployment model (Saas, Paas, Laas). In the case
            of public or community clouds, control is delegated to the organization owning the infrastructure. When
            deploying on a public cloud, control is mitigated to the infrastructure owner to enforce a sufficient security
            policy that guarantees that appropriate security activities are being performed to ensure that risk is reduced.
            This introduces a number of risks and threats, as essentially security is related to trusting the processes
            and computing base implemented by the cloud owner. It is crucial to differentiate between deployment models,
            as a private cloud, where the infrastructure is operated and managed on premise by a private organization,
            does not introduce additional unique security challenges, as trust remains within the organization.
            In such a situation, the infrastructures owner remains the data and process owner.</p>

          <hr>

        <h1 class="text-center">Section 3 - Cloud Service Models</h1>
          <p>Different types of cloud computing service models provide different levels of security services. In other
              words, the threats vary depending on the deployment model and, hence, the required security measures required
              vary based on the type of cloud model — software-as-a-service (SaaS), infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), or
              platform-as-a-service model (PaaS).</p>

          <p><b>Software-as-a-Service (SaaS):</b> In SaaS, the business’s information in the cloud is kept beyond the
              organizational boundary. For this model, extra security policies are needed in order to prevent data
              security and potential exposures in the application. SaaS delivery model poses security challenges such
              as data integrity, availability and confidentiality, authorization and authentication, and network attacks.
              SaaS centrally hosts software and data that are accessible via a browser.</p>

          <p><b>Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS): </b>IaaS provides the storage and networking components to cloud networking.
              It relies heavily on application programming interfaces (APIs) to allow enterprises to manage and interact with the
              cloud. However, cloud APIs tend to be insecure since they are open and readily accessible on the network.</p>

          <p><b>Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS): </b>In PaaS, the users controls the applications that run in cloud environment,
              but it does not control the hardware or network substructure and operating systems. Lack of validation,
              anonymous sign ups and service fraud are major issues of PaaS.</p>

        <h1 class="text-center">Section 4 - Fundamental Security Measures</h1>

        <p>This section will provide an overview of different ways you can manage security in the cloud. Be sure to check out
            the videos for a more in depth look at these different methods!</p>

        <p><b>Firewalls </b>protect the perimeter of your network security and your end users. Firewalls also safeguard
            traffic between different apps stored in the cloud.</p>

        <p><b>Access controls </b> protect data by allowing you to set access lists for different assets. For instance,
            you might allow specific employees application access, while restricting others. A general rule is to provide
            employees’ access to only the tools they need to do their job. By maintaining strict access control, you can
            keep critical documents from malicious insiders or hackers with stolen credentials.</p>

          <p><b>Data masking</b> encrypts identifiable information, such as names.
              This maintains data integrity by keeping important information private. With data masking, a medical
              company can share data without violating HIPAA laws, for example. Be sure to see our section on
            <a href="./crypto.html">Cryptography</a> to learn more about encryption!</p>

          <p><b>Threat intelligence</b> spots security threats and ranks them in order of importance. This feature helps you
              protect mission-critical assets from threats.</p>

          <p><b>Disaster recovery</b> provides flexible and reliable failover for required services in the event of any service
              interruptions, including those caused by natural or man-made disasters or disruptions. This makes use of the
              cloud's flexibility to minimize cost and maximize benefits.</p>

                  <div class="">Access control focuses on ensuring that only authorized personnel can view or change sensitive
                      data. While access control can protect sensitive data in production environments, the same cannot
                      be said when the data leaves the production stage.
                      Data Masking encrypts personal identifiable information, such as names, emails, phone numbers, etc.
                      By doing this, sensitive information is kept hidden outside the live production stage while
                      maintaining the data’s integrity.

        <h1 class="text-center">Section 1 - Why Do You Need Anti-Virus Software?</h1>
          <p>A <b>virus</b> is a type of malware that spreads to and infects other systems. They can steal passwords and data,
              corrupt files, and cause damage to your system. To avoid this problem, anti-virus software is needed to detect
              viruses and prevent them from harming your system. Below are summaries and videos of the detection techniques
              that anti-virus software implement. Remember, anti-virus software does not perfectly protect your system from threats.
              The user needs to be smart when browsing the web.</p>

          <h1 class="text-center">Section 2 - Signature-Based Detection</h1>

          <p><b>Signature Based Detection</b> is one of the main techniques in virus detection software. The idea behind it is
              simple: look for threats that look like previous threats. When a new type of threat appears, a profile, or
              a signature, is created for this type of threat. This way, a system can find threats that are similar to ones
              that you already know about. The downside to this method is that there needs to be an initial threat that enters
              your system before you can have a signature on it. In other words, the signatures that your system has can’t
              identify unknown threats. At the same time, attackers may be able to change what threats “look like” through
              polymorphism, as they spread from system to system. This means that a signature-based detection algorithm may
              not always be useful.</p>

          <h1 class="text-center">Section 3 - Behavioral-Based Detection</h1>

          <p><b>Behavioral-Based Detection</b> is similar to signature-based detection. Instead of looking at signatures, this
              detection algorithm looks at how a program intends to act upon a system. A program entering a system will be
              analyzed for any suspicious activity. If the program acts in an abnormal way, it will be labeled malicious.
              A benefit of this detection algorithm is that it can help to uncover unknown threats; a downside of this algorithm
              is that some objects may be incorrectly labeled as malicious when they are not.</p>

          <h1 class="text-center">Section 4 - Heuristic-Based Detection</h1>

          <p><b>Heuristic-Based Detection</b> looks for threats by searching for specific aspects., such as potentially malicious
              commands or instructions. Each program is graded based off how dangerous it can be. After a certain threshold,
              a program is deemed as malicious. The more malicious attributes, such as malicious commands, a program has,
              the higher its danger. In this algorithm, file analysis, file emulation, and genetic signature detection are used.
              File analysis looks at the intent of a program; file emulation tests a program in a controlled environment
              to see what it will do; genetic signature detection compares programs against virus signatures.</p>

                Even when using signature based detection, why can threats still harm your system? </button>
            <div id="collapse1" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
              <div class=""> Signature based detection is reactionary. A threat needs to enter your system in order
                  for the system to make a signature of it. Also, there are variations of threats, which the system
                  may not have a signature for.</div>

                <div class="">What we deem as bad behaviors does not necessarily indicate that a program is malicious.
                    The definitions of bad behaviors need to improve in order to reduce the amount of false positives.

                In heuristic based detection, can a new virus enter your system undetected?</button>
            <div id="collapse3" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
                <div class=""> Yes, because programs can appear to be non-malicious, so the system won’t detect its negative
                    attributes. Also, a program can be malicious and be under the threshold for something to be malicious.
                    When this happens, a malicious program can still enter the system. Even so, it is still possible that
                    the system can detect brand new programs if they have enough negative attributes.</div>

            <div id="collapse4" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
                <div class="">Heuristic based detection has more false positives, since we are looking at more aspects of
